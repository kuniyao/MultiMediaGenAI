in our world are now over here.

more like the Yakuza League.

368

to rule more than Hinomoto.

They've figured out a way
to reach Amatsukuni

373
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,029
by having Bari the Fleet Foot
create a tornado.

374
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,489
[Robin] Let me get this straight.

375
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,575

to spin up a tunnel

376
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,952

377
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,079
[Daiana] Unless someone stops them,

378
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,999
the Hagane Family
will overrun Amatsukuni

379
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,959
and eventually take it over.

380
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,920
I cannot turn a blind eye
to such a thing.

381
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,756
We battle injustice and help the weak.

382
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,093
The righteous do not deserve
these horrible actions.

383
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,096
It goes against the Ninkyo way.

384
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,849
This is Lake Inokashira.

385
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:47,228
In the middle is Nyogogashima,
the Isle of Women.

386
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,607
It is also where the
god Benzaiten resides.

387
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,401
Legends say
that when calamity befalls us,

388
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,822
an incarnation of Benzaiten
will arise to save all of Japan.

389
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,034
I was bestowed a fraction
of Benzaiten's powers

390
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,535
and then dispatched here.

391
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,454

and the Ninkyo spirit--

393
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,250
and I will do that with my life.

394
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,336
Kinda seems
like Wonder Woman's personality

395
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,504

Some form of convergent evolution.

399
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,390
The heroes have likely had
some evolutionary changes

400
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,434
due to the ecology of this world.

401
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,519

No. It's doubtful
for so many elements

to develop the Quake Engine
and use it to warp space-time.

was created by the Quake Engine.

[Ra’s al Ghul] Oh, it's far more advanced
than that.

662
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,392
I improved upon its design

663
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,645
to allow the engine
to shift space-time itself.

664
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,274
The idea was to stack
multiple worlds over each other

665
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,026
and change their shape.

666
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:48,073
I could conjure an entirely new world
by simply overlaying different scenarios,

667
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:51,952
and this yakuza version
of Japan was ultimately born.

668
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:57,791
So, what if an alien from Krypton
who was meant to end up in America

669
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:02,254
instead landed in Japan and
was raised by a yakuza family?

670

What if there was an island of women
in the middle of Lake Inokashira?

And what if a descendant
of the gods was born there?

672
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,810
And what if there was
a species of aquatic people

673

living at the bottom of Lake Inokashira,

674
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,232
and their queen fell in love
with a yakuza gangster

675
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,401
and gave birth to a son

676
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,196
who grew up to become
ruler of the aquatic race

677
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,698
and a yakuza lieutenant as well?

678
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,575
I feel like you cut that short.

679
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,036
[Ra’s al Ghul] What if a low-level yakuza thug

680

while in a hot spring,

681
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,584
and obtained the ability to run
even faster than a thunderbolt?

682
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,048
What if a gambler found herself
in trouble and on the run,

683
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,218
and just so happened to stumble
across a hidden power ring

684
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,928
and its energy supply?

685
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,476
By folding and overlapping
all these various scenarios,

686
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,605
one can form them into an
entirely new thing altogether,

687
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:05,484
like shaping a crane out of
a single sheet of paper.

The Four-Dimensional Origami System...

689

That is what I have chosen
to call my brilliant new device.

Now there is a country ruled
entirely by violent gangsters,

00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,375
my very own army of assassins.

00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,378
All I have to do is send them

[Batman] Science Ninja Technique:
Electrolysis.

1041
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,563
Take it from me,
there is no bigger threat

1042
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,815
than having a friend turn foe.

1043
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,820
-[insects chirping]
-[hatch whirs]

1044
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,906
Thanks for getting me
out of that sticky situation.

1045
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,284
Same to you. I appreciate it.

1046
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,953
I am grateful you returned
with your henchmen.

1047
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,997
They seem very capable.

1048
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,167
Since the Hagane-ikka launched
an attack on my family,

1049
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,043
it means that they must be ready

1050
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,963
to unleash their full-scale invasion
on Amatsukuni.

1051
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,964
As I thought.

1052
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,258
-That's precisely why we came here.
-[device beeping]

1053
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,926
-[Red Robin] Batman.
-Huh?

1054
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,762
We found the Quake Engine.

1055
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,764
It's in the heart
of the Yakuza Tower.

1056
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,766
What is the Quake Engine?

1057
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,851
It's a machine that's
been keeping this country stable

1058
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,604
by connecting it
to an interdimensional fissure.

1059
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,647
But once we destroy it,

1060
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,776
Hinomoto should go back to being
part of its original world.

1061
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,403
So you're saying
it's something like an anchor,

1062
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,447
and once we cut it loose,
we're free?

1063
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,948
That about sums it up.

1064
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,116
Huh?

1065
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,411
-[energy crackling]
-[wind howling]

1066
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,832
-Nightwing, let's get moving.
-Right.

1067
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,334
I'm going with you.

1068
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,796
I'm a native of Hinomoto,
and we should clean up our own mess.

1069
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,340
That is exactly what
I'd expect from you.

1070
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,426
Yeah, you're not too different
from the person I know.

1071
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,221
The one called Wonder Woman, right?

1072
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,515
Robin mentioned her before.

1073
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,433
Yes. That's correct.

1074
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,353
[Daiana] I've always had this feeling
that I wasn't alone,

1075
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,481
that there was someone like me
out there somewhere.

1076
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,775
Ahsa seemed to share
the same sentiment.

1077
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,486
-Yeah?
-I shall not bring shame to her

1078
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,780
by living below her standards.

1079
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,825
Perhaps she's the reason
I protect the Ninkyo

1080
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:01,327
and why I keep its spirit alive.

1081
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,246
I wouldn't worry about that.

1082
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,082
You're exactly how
you should be, wherever you are.

1083
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,333
Hop on in.

1084
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,543
No.

1085
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,503
I tend to get carsick.

1086
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,629
Ha!

1087
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,840
Huh. Go figure.

1088
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,882
Let's go.

1089

-[energy crackling]
-[wind howling]

1090
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,638
[Ra’s al Ghul] Within the ranks
of the Japanese yakuza

1091
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:25,309
are sacrificial assassins sent to kill
the bosses of rival syndicates.

1092
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,395
They are like human bullets.

1093

[snarling]

1094
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:33,192
And now those men will quite literally
be fired straight into Gotham,

1095
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,486
willing to pay the ultimate price.

1098
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,702
Now give 'em hell!

Huh? This is so dumb.

1103
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,050
You guys are

1105

[Red Hood] It's like a damn Yakuza Tornado,
and it's about to hit Gotham!

1106
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,475
Very good.
It's building up from the ground,

1107
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,477
just like a real tornado.

1108
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:09,979
Not like a downburst.

1109
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:10,980
Huh?

1110
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,648
There seemed to be
some confusion earlier.

1111
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,650
[Red Hood] What are you, a weatherman?
We gotta stop it.

1112
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,152
Yeah, yeah. Hang on.

1113
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:22,575
We need to amplify the
space-time pulse that's within us

1114
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,286
and block the Speed Force
from crossing dimensions.

we're screwing around?

I should be faster
than these chumps

you're bound to get hungry

doesn't really feel like a win.

Aw, come on.

[device clicks]

1220
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:26,462
You've got some guts to make
a mockery of my henchmen,

1221
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,548
but it's the last thing you'll do.

[both breathing heavily]

1238
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,887
[Kuraku] You cannot win.

1239
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,139
You are going to pay
for defying us

1240
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,892
by spending the rest
of your lives in pain.

1241

Hmph.

1246
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,788
It's about time you showed up,
bat fiend.

1247
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:46,417
I'm here to get Robin back.

1248
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,794
I'm sure you love your son.

1249
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:52,715
Sadly, your other sidekicks
are already dead.

1250
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:54,425
Hm?

[both grunt]

1252
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,638
I've got bad news for you, Kuraku.

Daiana.

1254
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,684
Ahsa...

1255
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:07,062

Get in!

01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,736
All of you, go to secure the
Quake Engine and find Robin.

1259
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:14,945
Come on!

1263
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,887
Zeshika has been defeated.

You're the only member
of the Hagane Family standing.

1265
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:46,769
Yes, well, that is hardly a problem.

1266
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,355
Not with me around.

1268
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:52,691
Ha!

1269
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,324
I am the Man of Steel,

1270
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,284
master of the underworld.

1271
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:05,162
Kuraku will show you no mercy!

1272
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:12,669
And as long as I live,
the Hagane-gumi will never die!

-[glass breaks]
-[electricity crackles]

1274
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:20,886

-[Daiana grunts]
-Hm!

1276
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,807
The power you wield,

1277
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,267
why do you not use it
to help other people?

1278
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,269
To help others?

1279
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,979
That's what I'm doing.

1280
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:33,357
This is humanity's true nature.

1281
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,609
They have a desire
to hurt each other

1282
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,070
and rule from the moment of birth.

1283
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:42,616
The only way to govern this world
is to suppress their evil tendencies

1284
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,244
-with an even greater evil!
-[gasps]

1285

[cape fluttering]

1289
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,153
[Batman] Daiana, you should
head for Yakuza Tower, too.

1290
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,112
Yes, but--

1291
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,323
Stopping the Quake Engine
is our top priority right now.

1292
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,701
I'll handle things here myself.

1293
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,203
[grunts]

1294
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,998
[Kuraku] You think all that fancy machinery

1295
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,208
will be enough to stop me?

1296
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:36,003
[dramatic music playing]

1297
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,672
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

[Nightwing] This is where the Quake Engine is.

1301
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,397
[Red Robin] Can we take the elevator?

1302
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,149
They could just stop it
and screw us over.

1303
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,942
We can run up the stairs.

1304
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,611
[sarcastically] Oh, yay.

I knew you were
nothing more than a fraud.

There's only one fraud here,

-and that would be you.

[grunting, groaning]

1331
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:30,284
What'd you do?

1332
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,910
[Batman] You're not from here.

1333
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,329
You were born
on a different planet.

1334
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,540
The only way you have
such incredible powers

1335
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,209
is when you're exposed
to the sun rays here on Earth,

1336
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,713
your superhuman strength
and your body of steel,

1337
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,715
your power to fly,

1338
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,051
and your ability to shoot
heat vision from your eyes.

1339
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:49,303
However...

1340
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:54,099
when exposed to the red sun rays
from your birth planet,

1341
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,686
then you become just like
any other normal human being.

1342
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,646
That's not possible.

1343
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,939
Hm?

1344
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,527
[gasps] Huh?

1345
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:07,321
You did this?

1346
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,449
[triumphant music playing]

1347
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:14,453
[Batman] Yes. That's right.
You didn't destroy my machine.

1348
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,998
You helped me arrange it
into the proper positions.

1349
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,293
By configuring this collection
of crystals into a filter,

1350
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,170
I turned the Earth's yellow sunlight

1351
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:27,215
into the exact same type of light
found on your birth planet.

1352

[grunting, groaning]

1355
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,733
You feel that?

1356
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,194
That's what we humans call pain.

1357
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:48,820
You never knew what it felt like

1358
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:51,114
because you've always
lived with incredible strength.

1359
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,741
-[groans]
-Hurts, doesn't it?

1360
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,662
This is the pain of all the people
you're trying to tyrannize.

1361
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:59,581
Everyone living normal lives
in Amatsukuni.

1362
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,584
[breathing heavily]

1363
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:03,585
Normal?

1364
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,004
There's nothing normal
about the yakuza.

1365
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:07,172
Yakuza?

1366
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,632
Yeah, that's right!

1367
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,802
I know that Amatsukuni
is the same as Hinomoto.

1368
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,471
It's filled with nothing but yakuza.

1369
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,307
[sighs] Unbelievable.

1370
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:20,769
You never gave a second thought
to all that crap Ra's al Ghul fed you.

1371
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,729
You mean he lied?

1372
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:26,191
Most people living in
Amatsukuni are average citizens.

1373
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:29,653
Or as a friend once put it,
"good, honest people. "

1374
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,948
The whole reason I fight
is to protect those people

1375
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,950
from criminals like the yakuza.

1376
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:38,537
[Kuraku] You don't expect me to
believe that nonsense, do you?

1377
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,373
Oh, no, you don't have to
take my word for it.

1378
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,542
Your arrogance will be your end!

1379
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:47,254

1381
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,344
Is that all you've got, Kuraku?

[gasps]

1383
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:00,934
[gasps, whimpers]

1384
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,770
What's the matter?
Are you afraid of me?

1385
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:08,024
I know a man who is
remarkably similar to you.

1386
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,526
Except...

1387
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:14,573
losing his superpowers wasn't enough
to stop him from having a heart of steel.

1388
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,783
He kept on fighting
through sheer willpower

1389
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:19,619
and did whatever it took to save lives.

1390
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:24,875
If I'm enough to strike fear in you,
then you're nothing compared to him.

1391
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,085
And you never will be.

1392
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:28,754
You'll never amount to anything.

1393
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,130
Ha!

1394
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,341
[mirror clanks]

1395
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:35,761
[gasps]

1396
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:39,055
[laughs]

1397
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,391
They're back.

1398
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:45,020
I can feel all my powers
returning to me.

1399
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:49,024
Now I'm going to make you regret
ever talking to me like that.

1400
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,025
Die!

1401
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,526
Just as expected.

1402
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,113
Hyah!

1403
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,116
[shouts, groans]

1404
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,539

[sputtering weakly]

1406
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,258
Kryptonite!

1407
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:16,510
Your weakness.

1408
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,971
It nullifies the powers
of Kryptonians like you.

1409
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:23,892
This was entrusted to me by
the very man I told you about.

1410
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,852
He wanted me to use it to stop him

1411
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,939
if he ever lost control
and went on a rampage.

1412
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:33,151
You two may look the same
on the outside,

1413
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:37,197
but you don't even have a fraction
of his pride or his heart.

1414
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,574
[sputters, exhales sharply]

1415
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:42,160
[triumphant music playing]

1416
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:53,171
I'm coming for you next, Ra's.

1417
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,469
I never expected Kuraku to lose.

1418
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,239
Hm.

1419
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,575
Hm.

1420
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,121

1421
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,873

1423
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:32,627
[chuckles]

1424

[gasps]

1425
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,046
Wha--

1426
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,257
[men shouting]

1427
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,681
Aw, man. This was supposed to be
my time to shine.

1428
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,684
Your father asked me
to come help you out.

1429
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:50,061
-Your friends are here as well.
-[blade creaking]

1430
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:51,980
Are they your older brothers?

1431
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,481
You all look pretty similar.

1432
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:54,941
You've got to be kidding.

1433
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,860
They're just posers
who think they came first.

1434
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,446
[device humming softly]

1435
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:05,744
Ra's the Great Oyabun,
your family is finished.

1436
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,455
The leader of the Bat Family
has defeated them all.

1437
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,540
Ha! Your big plan has failed,
Grandpa.

1438
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,709
You won't be able to send
your stupid goons

1439
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,544
-over to Gotham anymore.
-Hm.

1440
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:16,546
Very well, then.

1441
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,632
I guess it's time for plan B.

1442
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,716
[machine whirs]

1443
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:20,926
[glass shatters]

1444
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:26,598
So glad you could make it,
Detective.

1445
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:29,225
But once again,
you're a little too late.

1446
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,186
He's got
the space-time converter.

1447
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:32,312
What is that?

1448
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:35,690
I can only guess it's the key part
of his time travel machine.

1449
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:38,443
[rumbling, energy pulsing]

1450
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:39,778
[gasps]

1451
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,781
[energy intensifying]

1452
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,325
[gasps]

1453
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,870
[dramatic music playing]

1454
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,873
[gasps]

1455
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:54,960
[thunder rumbling]

1456
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:02,884
Dear God. What is that?

1457
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,725
What have you done? Ra's?!

1458
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:13,186
I deactivated the energy modulator,

1459
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,731
sending the Four-Dimensional
Origami System out of control.

1460
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:19,734
Now nothing holds Hinomoto in place,

1461
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:24,990
which will cause the Tokyo area
to rematerialize in the other world.

1462
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,659
Gotham City will be crushed.

1463
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,786
-Ra's, no!
-That is going to impact

1464
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,287
far more than Gotham!

1465
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,040
The shockwave alone
will bring a global disaster.

1466
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,292
This cannot be what you want.

1467
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,087
Oh, well, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

1468
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,173
The shockwave will
be absorbed within the fissure,

1469
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:46,428
so it won't be like a meteor
or anything that exciting.

1470
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,889
In fact, I would consider
it an improvement.

1471
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:53,810
This nation of yakuza will purge
and purify all the rotten filth.

1472
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,979
Eh, sounds kinda overboard
to me.

1473
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,647
Hm! Ha!

1474
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,482
[gasps]

1475
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:01,860
[breathing rapidly]

1476
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,863
Hya-- [gasps]

1477
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,824
[Daiana] It's gone.

1478
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,118
Mm.

1479
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:11,494
Batman!

1480
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,121
Where's the Quake Engine?

1481
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,874
Yeah, so, uh...
it sort of disappeared.

1482
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,042
[Red Hood] It did what?!

1483
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:20,253
The Bat Family makes
its grand entrance.

1484
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,880
But unfortunately for you,

1485
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:24,674
your superior numbers
make no difference here.

1486
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,970
Since the Four-Dimensional
Origami System no longer has limits,

1487
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:33,558
it is now operating while sliding through
multiple space-time continuums,

1488
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,686
which means anyone
within this part of space-time

1489
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,313
won't even be able to touch it.

1490
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,606
That can't be.

1491
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,900
What is this lunatic
even talking about?!

1492
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,694
It's like he's gambling
and cheating at the table.

1493
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:46,863
He's hidden the dice that
are supposed to be in the cup,

1494
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,157
and now nobody gets a roll.

1495
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,160
Ridiculous.
Then it's not even a game!

1496
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,079
-[energy warbling]
-Huh? Ah!

1497
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:56,539
Yes, exactly.

1498
01:12:57,207 --> 01:13:00,418
I've no intention
of taking a gamble with you.

1499
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,379
-Well, in that case...
-Huh?

1500
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:04,964
-Huh?
-Hmm?

1501
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,175
...then why don't I
do the gambling?

1502
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,097
[energy warbling]

1503
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,181
There it is!

1504
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,224
What?

1505
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,768
Our bodies have been exposed
to a space-time pulse

1506
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,062
emitted from the Quake Engine.

1507
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,690
It may be possible for us to
focus that energy on the device

1508
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:27,195
as it fluctuates through space-time
and then anchor it to this continuum.

1509
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,781
That's the gamble
I'm willing to take.

1510
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,699
Sounds cool. I'm in!

1511
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:33,868
[warbling intensifies]

1512
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:35,161
We'll join, too!

1513
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:36,496
No, you won't!

1514
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:37,580

1515
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:39,249

away from him!

[dramatic music playing]

1520
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:05,608
Did it work?

1521
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,653
Not yet. We need more energy.

1522
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,029
Five of us isn't enough?

[triumphant music playing]

1534

[Batman] Losing his superpowers wasn't
enough to stop him from having a heart of steel.

1535
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,905
He kept on fighting
through sheer willpower

1536
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,574
and did whatever it took
to save lives.

1537
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:59,996
If I'm enough to strike fear in you,
then you're nothing compared to him.

1538

01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,303
[Batman] It must be recoil
from the Origami System.

01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:45,810
Tokyo has physically manifested
itself outside of the fissure

1568
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:49,522
and is now being affected
by Earth's gravity.

1569
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,817
And there is nothing you can do
to stop it.

1570
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,152
Yes, there is.

1571
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:57,488
I can still take back the
space-time converter from you

1572
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:59,365
and then stop the device.

1573
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,659
Mm. That's a valid point.

1574
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,328
Right.

1575
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:05,121
Then let's complicate things.

1576
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,039
[device clicks]

1577
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,999

1580
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,137
[Batman] What the hell have you done?!

1581
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,349
[Ra’s al Ghul] I've detonated the base
of the structure.

1582
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:27,268
Even if this tower is the
only thing to fall on Gotham,

1583
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:29,979
it's still enough
to raze the city to the ground!

1584
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:31,856
You're a damn monster!

1585
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,067
Farewell, then, Detective!

1586
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,112
[chuckles smugly]

1587
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:43,493
Now you and your little Bat Family
can go back to Gotham...

1588
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,037
as a pile of bloody corpses.

1589
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,416
[laughs evilly]

1590
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,667
[man] Aah!

1591

[Alfred] At last, a signal!

1598
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,148
Master Bruce, can you hear me?

1599
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:16,442
Copy, Alfred. What's going on?

1600
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:20,279
The fine ladies and gentlemen of
the Yakuza League are protecting Gotham.

[gasps]

1602

Arise!

1610
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,900

Hmm?

1614
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:17,837
[Ra’s al Ghul] How is he doing that?

1615

[Batwing reverberating]

1623
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,541
[Batman] I have the space-time converter.

-You got it back!
-[all] Whoa!

1625
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,754

It didn't work!

[Kuraku] Is that you, Daiana?

1634
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,528
So what made you change your mind?

1635
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,490
I saw the man,
the other version of me.

1636
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:33,120
He risked his life to protect the innocent
and vulnerable people in his world.

1637
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,665
That is when I realized...

1638
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,292
he and I are the same,

1639
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:41,087
both in heart and soul.

And I see the same is true
for them as well.

1642
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:48,344
[Daiana] Yes. That's right.

1643
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,137
It's the Ninkyo spirit.

1644
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:51,973
[Kuraku] I suppose it is.

1645
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,183
We must hang on.

1646
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,061
The Bat Oyabun will find
a way out of this...

1647
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,313
with a little help from a friend.

1648
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,110

some trouble there, B-man?

Harley? What the hell
are you doing here?

1651
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,534
I'm just gonna leave
if you use your mean voice.

1652
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,912
Be nice, and I might
just lend you a hand.

1653
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,539
Daiana gave me a call.

1654
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,791
She said you would need
some saving.

1655
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,544
And how could I turn down
a request from her?

1656
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,129
Daiana sent you?

1657
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,255
I see.

1658
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,258
When she disappeared,
she was actually going to get you.

1659
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:29,343
Exactamundo!

1660
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:31,012
Well, we need to move quickly!

1661
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:33,723
I know even you don't want to
see Gotham destroyed.

1662
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,182
Eh.

[Batwing whooshes]
Hmm?

1675
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:16,974
[Batman] Take the Four-Dimensional
Origami System back to Hinomoto

1676
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,601
and destroy it there.

1677
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,562
That will enable the island to
slip out of the space-time fissure

1678
01:22:21,646 --> 01:22:23,606
and return your world to normal.

1679
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,191
[Daiana] And that will be the end?

1680
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,192
[Batman] Yes.

1681
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,944
The connection between
our two worlds will be severed.

1682
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,406
Good. Then we'll take
this whole tower back with us.

1683
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,326
Wouldn't want it
to land here on your fine city.

1684
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,702
I'll help you.

1685
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,206
No, this is our mess to clean up.

Enjoy this spectacle.
It won't happen again.

Thanks for everything you've done,
Oyabun of the Bat Family.

1703
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,766
We will never forget
all your kind efforts.

1704
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:45,146
Once you return, your world will
no longer be a land filled with yakuza.

1705
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:48,357
The honorable and the innocent
will live there now as well.

Sounds much better to me.

Did I hear that correctly?

1708
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,406
You've come around to
the ways of the Ninkyo spirit?

1709
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:57,950
I saw the real thing...

1710
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,202
and so did they.

1711
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,291
Good. Glad to hear.

I think I'll stick with lake water.

01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,765
Turns out the ocean is really salty.

01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:22,850
You're seriously
just figuring that out?

I'm gonna feel it for a while.

1725

A space-time pulse wave.

1731
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:05,309
The Four-Dimensional Origami
System has been destroyed.

1732
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:08,229
Does that mean
we fixed history or whatever?

1733
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:11,315
Yeah. We're good.
Everything's back to normal.

1734
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,983
At least according to hairstyle.

Aah! Aw, not again!

01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,044
[Green Lantern] We know you just got back

1744
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,255
from your big time-traveling
adventure yesterday,

1745
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,422
but that's no excuse.

1746
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:36,340
[Wonder Woman] Get moving.

1747
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,842
We're all here waiting on you.

1748
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,343
[Superman] You okay, Bruce?

1749
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,512
Is there a problem?

1750
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:43,430
[chuckles] Sorry.

1751
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:44,932
I'll be right there.

1752
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:49,019
[slow ballad music playing]

1753
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:56,777
[singing in Japanese]

-Master Damian,

1755
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:44,992
would you care to try wearing a wig?

1756
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:49,538
I believe it would suit you quite well
and provide a less ostentatious look.

1757
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,874
[Damian] Alfred, leave me alone!

1758
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:55,961
[slow ballad music continues]

1759
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,052
[singing in Japanese]

1760
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,315
[singing ends]
